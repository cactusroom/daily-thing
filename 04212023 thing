Chapter 1 (incomplete)
The man walked down the streets of the capital with the kind of leisure reserved solely for the elderly. His gait remained patient and measured while life bustled in every corner. Children played, merchants hawked their wares, lovers revelled in each other's affection, and the man walked.

He took in the sights and sounds around him, and gave a gentle smile to anyone who met his gaze. The man saw a park up ahead and decided he would meander for a while before going on his way. He passed through the park gate and stepped into the world of nature – so detached, yet so intrinsically tied to the city. He spotted a young girl in a blue cotehardie brushing the dirt off her dress. He saw no parents paying her any mind, but it had been safe enough lately that children were free to play by themselves. He walked past.

A cool breeze swept through the park. The autumn leaves danced.

The man stopped in front of the lake to rest his aching legs for a moment. He couldn’t move like he used to; even a mild stroll through the park was taking its toll. He absentmindedly massaged his knees while watching the scenery. Ducks crowded the other shore as the baker’s wife tossed them bread crumbs. A family sat on a blanket, enjoying the last few weeks of good weather before the cold settled in. Boys brandished their wooden swords and played knights and damsels. 

A youth in purple accosted a maiden daydreaming by the waterside. They looked around to check for spectators before starting to blush and giggle as they chatted with playful coquetry. After a while he leaned in and whispered in her ear before taking off his gold ring to place in her hands. He closed her fingers around the ring and gave a parting kiss to her cheek. She flushed red and held it to her chest while walking briskly away. 

The youth sat for a moment, basking in his accomplishment. He laid on the grass with his hands interlocked behind his head, gazing at the clouds drifting past. After his heart slowed and his face cooled, the youth stood back up and strutted across the shore to where another innocent maiden was waiting. He took a new gold ring out of his pocket and secured it onto his finger with practiced ease.
 
The man sighed and stopped watching. He took out a quill and a roll of parchment from his robe and began to sketch the lake. The sun’s gentle rays washed away the morning chill. 

Time passed while the man continued to work. Leaves rustled and fell, dyeing the world in gold and red. The sun rose to its peak. 

The man looked at his completed work and smiled at the day’s drawing. He picked up the quill again and wrote a message in the center of the lake.

The third prince continues his frivolous behaviour. We will prepare adequate compensation for the houses of the two maidens. Word will be sent to his teachers to reprimand further displays. He continues to lack ambition on the surface.
The common folk are living well. Children feel safe to play. Craftsmen are well fed and have extra to spare. Merchants are lively. The city flourishes under new rule. Long live Your Majesty.

The man rolled the parchment and tied it with a practiced hand. Palming it into his robe, he stood up and continued his lap around the park, giving a gentle smile to any who met his gaze. He handed the scroll to a pedestrian strolling past, then left through the gate back into the urban world. He walked down the streets and continued to observe the city and its people.

His eyes were drawn to a girl in blue. The same girl from the park, still without any sign of her parents. He noticed fraying in the wool of her cotehardie, and signs that the same garb had been washed but not changed for months. Although her dress appeared light blue, a trained eye could tell that the lightened colour came from the sun-bleached fading of a much richer hue. It would pass for peasant garb to most people. Perhaps for the best.

Poor girl, the man thought as he walked by. He stealthily pulled a coin from his pocket and tossed it in front of her. The clank drew her attention and she looked around hurriedly for the sound that drew her out of the daydream. She saw the coin after a moment and picked it up. She looked around again with more urgency.

“Excuse me! Did somebody drop this?” She called out to the crowd.

They smiled at such an honest response to finding a single bronze and went about their day. 

Holding the coin, she asked a few nearby pedestrians if this was their lost coin. They shook their heads no, and the girl gave up her search for its original owner. She was dejected for a moment, but her expression quickly brightened as she skipped ahead, passing the man.

He continued walking at his leisurely pace. What a good child. His expression softened as he continued to observe the city.

In high spirits, the girl made her way to a meatbun stall just up ahead and proudly showed the owner her newfound coin. They chatted for a bit before she offered him the money.

Silly girl, that’s not enough to buy –

The owner handed her a bun and they winked at each other. Her eyes narrowed into two crescent moons as she smiled, before darting off into the alleyway. The owner gave her a quick nudge as she left and resumed hawking his goods.

– one of those buns. Or so it is.

The man continued walking. He casually glanced at the alley as he made his way past and saw the girl splitting the meatbun in half, offering it to a beggar sitting against the wall. She looked up and seemed to meet his gaze.

“Thank you, mister!” She called out while radiating joy.

Is she talking to me?

The girl waved frantically. The shop owner waved back.

Just my imagination. I’ve been too high strung lately, need a vacation. The man chuckled and continued walking.

A warm breeze swayed the hem of his robe.
