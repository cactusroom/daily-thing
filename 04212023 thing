Chapter 1
The man walked down the streets of the capital with the kind of leisure reserved solely for the elderly. His gait remained patient and measured while life bustled in every corner. Children played, merchants hawked their wares, lovers revelled in each other's affection, and the man walked.

He took in the sights and sounds around him, and gave a gentle smile to anyone who met his gaze. The man saw a park up ahead and decided he would meander for a while before going on his way. He passed through the park gate and stepped into the world of nature – so detached, yet so intrinsically tied to the city. He spotted a young girl in a blue cotehardie brushing the dirt off her dress. He saw no parents paying her any mind, but it had been safe enough lately that children were free to play by themselves. He walked past.

A cool breeze swept through the park. The autumn leaves danced.

The man stopped in front of the lake to rest his aching legs for a moment. He couldn’t move like he used to; even a mild stroll through the park was taking its toll. He absentmindedly massaged his knees while watching the scenery. Ducks crowded the other shore as the baker’s wife tossed them bread crumbs. A family sat on a blanket, enjoying the last few weeks of good weather before the cold settled in. Boys brandished their wooden swords and played knights and damsels. 

A youth in purple accosted a maiden daydreaming by the waterside. They looked around to check for spectators before starting to blush and giggle as they chatted with playful coquetry. After a while he leaned in and whispered in her ear before taking off his gold ring to place in her hands. He closed her fingers around the ring and gave her a parting kiss on the cheek. She flushed red and held it to her chest while walking briskly away.

The youth sat for a moment, basking in his accomplishment. He laid on the grass with his hands interlocked behind his head, gazing at the clouds drifting past. After his heart slowed and his face cooled, the youth stood back up and strutted across the shore to where another innocent maiden was waiting. He took a new gold ring out of his pocket and secured it onto his finger with practiced ease.
 
The man sighed and stopped watching. He took out a quill and a roll of parchment from his robe and began to sketch the lake. The sun’s gentle rays washed away the morning chill. 

Time passed while the man continued to work. Leaves rustled and fell, dyeing the world in gold and red. The sun rose to its peak. 

The man looked at his completed work and smiled at the day’s drawing. He picked up the quill again and wrote a message in the center of the lake.

The third prince continues his frivolous behaviour. We will prepare adequate compensation for the houses of the two maidens. Word will be sent to his teachers to reprimand further displays. He continues to lack ambition on the surface.
The common folk are living well. Children feel safe to play. Craftsmen are well fed and have extra to spare. Merchants are lively. The city flourishes under new rule. Long live Your Majesty.

The man rolled the parchment and tied it with a practiced hand. Palming it into his robe, he stood up and continued his lap around the park, giving a gentle smile to any who met his gaze. He handed the scroll to a pedestrian strolling past, then left through the gate back into the urban world. He walked down the streets and continued to observe the city and its people.

His eyes were drawn to a girl in blue. The same girl from the park, still without any sign of her parents. He noticed fraying in the wool of her cotehardie, and signs that the same garb had been washed but not changed for months. Although her dress appeared pale blue, a discerning eye would reveal that the lightened colour came from the sun-bleached fading of a much richer hue. It would pass for peasant garb to most people. Perhaps for the best.

Poor girl, the man thought as he walked by. He stealthily pulled a coin from his pocket and tossed it in front of her. The clank drew her attention and she looked around hurriedly for the sound that drew her out of the daydream. She saw the coin after a moment and picked it up. She looked around again with more urgency.

“Excuse me! Did somebody drop this?” She called out to the crowd.

They smiled at such an honest response to finding a single bronze and went about their day. 

Holding up the coin, she asked a few nearby pedestrians if they had dropped this by mistake. They each shook their heads no. With nobody claiming the lost coin, the girl could only give up her search for its original owner. She hesitated for a moment, but decided to pocket the bronze. Her expression brightened once again as she skipped ahead, passing the man. The dilemma forgotten as quickly as it arose.

He continued walking at his leisurely pace. What a good child. His expression softened as he continued to observe the city.

In high spirits, the girl made her way to the meatbun stall just up ahead and proudly showed the owner her newfound coin. They chatted for a bit before she offered him the money.

Silly girl, that’s not enough to buy –

The owner handed her a bun and they winked at each other. Her eyes narrowed into two crescent moons as she smiled at him, before darting off into the alleyway. The owner gave her a playful shove as she left and resumed hawking his goods.

– one of those buns. Or so it is.

The man continued walking. He casually glanced at the alley as he made his way past and saw the girl splitting the meatbun in half, offering it to a beggar sitting against the wall. She looked up and seemed to meet his gaze.

“Thank you, mister!” She called out while radiating joy.

Is she talking to me?

The girl waved frantically. The shop owner waved back.

Just my imagination. I’ve been too high strung lately, need a vacation. The man chuckled and continued walking.

A warm breeze swayed the hem of his robe.

Shadows lengthened as time passed and the sun started its descent beyond the horizon. The cobblestone road was bathed in a faint orange glow. Fewer and fewer people could be seen milling about the streets, most opting to return to the comfort of their homes as the day came to a close.

The chill that had been kept at bay by the sun’s light started to creep its way back in as dusk settled. The man rubbed his hands together for warmth and took a small break on a roadside bench to massage his knees. He saw a familiar purple robe duck into an alleyway and sighed. The break was short-lived. The man got up to follow.

The alleyway was dark. Small pools of fetid water accumulated in potholes and the street gutters. The man frowned and continued to walk. He weaved in and out of the shadows, keeping himself concealed as he followed the third prince. Not a soul could be seen walking around. It was as if he had entered another world, cut off from the rest of the city.

The youth rounded a corner and entered the second building down. The man listened but could only hear indistinct murmuring from a quick exchange of words. He heard footsteps heading up a flight of wooden stairs and then silence. He continued to wait, but no further sounds could be heard from within. He frowned again and sighed. Prince, what are you up to?

The man took a deep breath to steel himself and reached for the handle of the front door. He threw the door open and immediately took a step back and to the side as a thug charged through the entryway swinging a broadsword. The sword travelled in a wide arc – the assailant putting their entire force behind the strike.

Uncontrolled, unbalanced.

Angling his body, the man stepped forwards and entered the space of his attacker, narrowly dodging the attack. He put one hand on the hilt of their blade and guided the momentum of the swing, pulling the thug out of position. His other hand reached for a dagger inside his robe. The thug tried to pull back after slicing through air, but the sudden void in his posture forced him to take a step forward, bringing him directly into the path of the dagger poised at his throat. The blade buried itself to the hilt with no resistance. 

Crossbowman on the right. 

The man dashed into the building, not sparing even a second to confirm the fate of his assailant. He grabbed the door with one hand and spun around to its left side, flinging it wide open and using it for cover. 

Thud. A crossbow bolt hit the door and splintered wood flew out. 

The man grabbed another dagger and rolled to avoid any incidental damage. Another armed thug was waiting on the left, but so surprised by the blitz maneuver, he barely had time to react. By the time the thug registered what was happening and started to swing his mace, the man had already pounced out of the roll. Springing from a low crouch, the man threw his entire weight upwards and thrust the dagger through the thug’s chin.

One more up the stairs.

Not bothering to retrieve the dagger, the man grabbed another from his robe and flung it at the crossbowman across the room. The unsuspecting victim would never get the chance to finish reloading. Blood poured out through the gaps in his fingers as clutched at his throat and sank to the floor.

The man looked up the stairs and saw the final target in the building. A burly knight clad in plate and chain drew his sword. The man studied him for a moment, his eyes lingering on the rich blue coat of arms adorning his breastplate. The knight was better trained than the previous attackers. He held the longsword close to his body, pointing forwards and down in a fool’s guard to make best use of the height advantage and narrow space of the staircase. It would be hard to approach from below, and useless to throw a knife. They stood there at an impasse and assessed the best way to break the deadlock.

There was a thud from the second floor and the knight turned his head to look. The man bounded up the stairs in this moment of inattention. Both of them knew this “opening” was a farce, but time was of the essence and the fight needed to be settled. The man unsheathed his main-gauche while running. The knight waited.

When they got within striking distance, the knight moved with explosive precision, stabbing at the man’s center. He flattened against the side of the staircase while parrying. Steel scraped against steel as the man closed the distance, blades crossed. The knight stepped back and disengaged his sword, trying to maintain the advantage of a longer weapon, but the narrow stairwell didn’t allow for much maneuvering. The knight pivoted his sword to the right, but the man followed the blade and pinned it against the wall. Only an arm’s length remained between the two as the man continued up the stairs. 

With his free hand, the knight threw a mailed fist at the man. The man weaved and parried the blow to the side. He continued forwards, rotating his hand and snaking around the knight’s arm to grapple their elbow. He tried to pull the knight down, but their posture was stable and the fist was retracted as soon as it shot out – a noncommittal test blow.

The knight dropped his sword, knowing it would be of no use in such close quarters. With his hand freed up, the knight moved to grab the man but the main-gauche heading towards his face forced him to retreat. The knight deflected the dagger with his forearm, using his armour to great effect, and pinned the man’s arm underneath his armpit. The man smiled and pushed his arm even further into the pin, closing the gap until their chests were connected. He wrapped his arm across the back of the knight and leaned back. They both started to fall down the stairs. The knight’s eyes widened and he tried to counteract the force, but momentum had already taken control.

The man put strength into his legs and jumped backwards while twisting, inverting their positions and retrieving his arm from behind the knight. They flew through the air and landed heavily onto the floor. The knight suffered the brunt of the impact, crushed by their combined weight. While the knight lay there dazed and winded, the man pulled out a dagger with his free hand and slashed his throat. Anger and unwillingness flitted through the knight’s eyes as his life seeped onto the floor. 

The man rolled over and panted heavily. His body was in agony but he knew that it would only get worse once the thrill of battle wore off. He got up off the floor with pained, laboured movements, and went outside to retrieve the corpse of the first thug before anybody found and reported it. He dragged the body inside the house with great effort, then closed the door and slumped his body against it. After resting for a moment, he retrieved his daggers from the corpses and cleaned them off with his robe. He emptied what remained in its pockets and then threw the garment into the lit fireplace. While reorganizing his belongings into the compartments of his trousers and tunic, the man called out to the empty house.

“You were too casual, prince. Easy to spot. Easy to follow. What are your intentions?”

There was no response.

The man finished packing away all of his items. 

“Fine. I’ll report back to your Royal Father. Return to the palace at once, Your Highness.”

The man went to the back of the house to fetch a pail of water. He washed the makeup off his face and the dye out of his hair. He thought back to the knight’s coat of arms. Just what is that boy thinking? Openly consorting with remnants of a bygone empire…

He inspected his body for wounds. Mostly unharmed other than massive bruising along his ribs, hip, and thigh from the fall. The man pulled out a few pieces of jewellery and tidied his appearance into the spitting image of a middle-aged merchant. He found a cane by the front door and grabbed it as he left. It should cover up for the limp that would surely form once the pain kicked in.

The man walked back into the city. The sun had long descended past the horizon and moonlight took its place to illuminate the streets.

Whose attention were you trying to grab, prince? Who are you trying to lure?
Chapter 2 (Incomplete)
The man limped down the street, his cane rhythmically striking the cobbles as he made his way home. He was looking forward to spending the night in bed, but dreaded the aches that would plague him come the morning. He split off from the main road and started winding through the alleys that would lead to his current safehouse.

Crossing through the residential district, the man idly watched the faint flicker of candlelight escaping from the windows of buildings. His legs moved automatically while his mind was occupied by the events of the day.

It’s already been several months since the empire changed hands. A new era of peace is finally on the horizon, so why now are the loyalists suddenly resuming activity?

He would have to report this matter directly to the emperor in the morning. Should also get someone to clean up those bodies.

The man reached a fork in the road and was about to turn to re-enter the alleyways when something caught his eye. Up ahead, the girl in blue was sat on a roadside bench, knees to her chest, staring blankly into space. The man paused. After some deliberation, he turned to leave.

A bitter cold wind swept through the streets. His tunic rippled. Her bunched-up dress fluttered.

The girl shivered.

The man turned the corner and left.

In the silence of night, a small sound was carried by the wind. He heard the grumble of an empty stomach and a childish voice.

“Shhh, shhh. Do you think that if you’re mute then I’ll forget that you’re there? Seriously.”

Pat. Pat. The girl consoled the “beast.”

The man walked down the alley for a few minutes and approached a building. The windows of the alehouse radiated a welcoming light. Inside, patrons could be seen eating and drinking peacefully, generally mindful to show respect as a guest in someone else’s home. The man entered and grabbed a seat. He leaned his cane against the wall and started to massage his knees while the hostess came over. 

“Long day of travelling?” she asked. 

“Business went well today, but I had to ferry these poor old legs all over the city,” he gave a self-deprecating smile.

“Pfft. That’s a nice new walking stick but you’re not that old. Anyways, what can I get for you?”

“A hot meal, whatever you recommend. And the usual,” he replied.

“Sure thing, coming right up!”

“Oh wait, before you go,” the man stopped her.

She looked at him questioningly. 

“Make that two meals. I’m going to bring one back.”

She paused for a moment before replying, “Alright, just remember to return the plate or we’ll charge you.”

“I’ve got plenty of money.”

“Bring the plate back.”

He chuckled and relaxed further into his chair.

The hostess returned after a quarter-hour with a plate and a tankard, both steaming. She set them on the table.

“Enjoy. Your other order will be done in a few minutes. Should still be warm by the time you leave.”

He gave a nod of thanks and began to eat with militaristic efficiency. He dismantled the meal, barely even registering the taste before taking the next bite. In a few short moments, he cleared the plate off. Mission complete, he sipped his hot drink, waiting for the server to return. 

When the second meal arrived, the man finished off the rest of his drink and stood up. He left two silvers on the table – more than enough for the meals and a tip. He walked out, leaving the warmth of the alehouse and returning to the cold night. With a meal in one hand and a cane in the other, the man retraced his steps back to the fork in the road.

The girl was still on the bench, lost in her own world. He walked up and sat beside her. She snapped out of her reverie and started to look around for the source of the disturbance. Her eyes were immediately drawn to the plate of food, wisps of steam drifting lazily through the air.

She stared at the glistening cut of pork, covered in a rich layer of gravy. The savoury aroma left her mouth watering. The vibrant colours of the beets and carrots were tantalizing. She saw flecks of spices and an unknown clear coating on their surface. A thick slice of rye completed the plate. Its bottom edge was wet, having soaked up some of the sauces from the rest of the meal. She could already imagine how sweet the dish would – her stomach grumbled.

She jumped with a start and seemed to wake up from her trance. She looked embarrassed after thinking about her rude actions, conveting somebody else’s meal. Her eyes raised away from the dish and she saw the man looking at her. His gaze was soft. He put the plate in her lap and handed her a spoon and knife. She looked at the food and then back up to him, asking for permission. He nodded. She ate.
