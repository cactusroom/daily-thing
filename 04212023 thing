Chapter 1 (incomplete)
The man walked down the streets of the capital with the kind of leisure reserved solely for the elderly. His gait remained patient and measured while life bustled in every corner. Children played, merchants hawked their wares, lovers revelled in each other's affection, and the man walked.

He took in the sights and sounds around him, and gave a gentle smile to anyone who met his gaze. The man saw a park up ahead and decided he would meander for a while before going on his way. He passed through the park gate and stepped into the world of nature – so detached, yet so intrinsically tied to the city. He spotted a young girl in a blue cotehardie brushing the dirt off her dress. He saw no parents paying her any mind, but it had been safe enough lately that children were free to play by themselves. He walked past.

A cool breeze swept through the park. The autumn leaves danced.

The man stopped in front of the lake to rest his aching legs for a moment. He couldn’t move like he used to; even a mild stroll through the park was taking its toll. He absentmindedly massaged his knees while watching the scenery. Ducks crowded the other shore as the baker’s wife tossed them bread crumbs. A family sat on a blanket, enjoying the last few weeks of good weather before the cold settled in. Boys brandished their wooden swords and played knights and damsels. 

A youth in purple accosted a maiden daydreaming by the waterside. They looked around to check for spectators before starting to blush and giggle as they chatted with playful coquetry. After a while he leaned in and whispered in her ear before taking off his gold ring to place in her hands. He closed her fingers around the ring and gave a parting kiss to her cheek. She flushed red and held it to her chest while walking briskly away. 

The youth sat for a moment, basking in his accomplishment. He laid on the grass with his hands interlocked behind his head, gazing at the clouds drifting past. After his heart slowed and his face cooled, the youth stood back up and strutted across the shore to where another innocent maiden was waiting. He took a new gold ring out of his pocket and secured it onto his finger with practiced ease.
 
The man sighed and stopped watching. He took out a quill and a roll of parchment from his robe and began to sketch the lake. The sun’s gentle rays washed away the morning chill. 

Time passed while the man continued to work. Leaves rustled and fell, dyeing the world in gold and red. The sun rose to its peak. 

The man looked at his completed work and smiled at the day’s drawing. He picked up the quill again and wrote a message in the center of the lake.

The third prince continues his frivolous behaviour. We will prepare adequate compensation for the houses of the two maidens. Word will be sent to his teachers to reprimand further displays. He continues to lack ambition on the surface.
The common folk are living well. Children feel safe to play. Craftsmen are well fed and have extra to spare. Merchants are lively. The city flourishes under new rule. Long live Your Majesty.

The man rolled the parchment and tied it with a practiced hand. Palming it into his robe, he stood up and continued his lap around the park, giving a gentle smile to any who met his gaze. He handed the scroll to a pedestrian strolling past, then left through the gate back into the urban world. He walked down the streets and continued to observe the city and its people.

His eyes were drawn to a girl in blue. The same girl from the park, still without any sign of her parents. He noticed fraying in the wool of her cotehardie, and signs that the same garb had been washed but not changed for months. Although her dress appeared pale blue, a discerning eye would reveal that the lightened colour came from the sun-bleached fading of a much richer hue. It would pass for peasant garb to most people. Perhaps for the best.

Poor girl, the man thought as he walked by. He stealthily pulled a coin from his pocket and tossed it in front of her. The clank drew her attention and she looked around hurriedly for the sound that drew her out of the daydream. She saw the coin after a moment and picked it up. She looked around again with more urgency.

“Excuse me! Did somebody drop this?” She called out to the crowd.

They smiled at such an honest response to finding a single bronze and went about their day. 

Holding up the coin, she asked a few nearby pedestrians if they had dropped this by mistake. They each shook their heads no. With nobody claiming the lost coin, the girl could only give up her search for its original owner. She hesitated for a moment, but decided to pocket the bronze. Her expression brightened once again as she skipped ahead, passing the man. The dilemma forgotten as quickly as it arose.

He continued walking at his leisurely pace. What a good child. His expression softened as he continued to observe the city.

In high spirits, the girl made her way to the meatbun stall just up ahead and proudly showed the owner her newfound coin. They chatted for a bit before she offered him the money.

Silly girl, that’s not enough to buy –

The owner handed her a bun and they winked at each other. Her eyes narrowed into two crescent moons as she smiled at him, before darting off into the alleyway. The owner gave her a playful shove as she left and resumed hawking his goods.

– one of those buns. Or so it is.

The man continued walking. He casually glanced at the alley as he made his way past and saw the girl splitting the meatbun in half, offering it to a beggar sitting against the wall. She looked up and seemed to meet his gaze.

“Thank you, mister!” She called out while radiating joy.

Is she talking to me?

The girl waved frantically. The shop owner waved back.

Just my imagination. I’ve been too high strung lately, need a vacation. The man chuckled and continued walking.

A warm breeze swayed the hem of his robe.

The cobblestone road was bathed in a faint orange glow as the sun started its descent beyond the horizon. The chill that had been kept at bay by the day’s light started to creep its way back in. The man rubbed his hands together for warmth and took a small break on a roadside bench to massage his knees. He saw a familiar purple robe duck into an alleyway and sighed. The break was short-lived. The man followed.

The alleyway was dark. Small pools of fetid water accumulated in potholes and the street gutters. The man frowned and continued to walk. He weaved in and out of the shadows, keeping himself concealed as he followed the youth in purple. Not a soul could be seen walking around. It was as if he had entered another world, cut off from the rest of the city.

The youth rounded a corner and entered the second building down. The man listened but could only hear indistinct murmuring from a quick exchange of words. He heard footsteps and then silence. He continued to wait, but the only reward was more silence. He frowned again and sighed. Prince, what are you up to?

The man took a deep breath to steel himself and opened the front door of the building. He threw the door open and immediately took a step back and to the side as a thug charged through the entryway swinging a broadsword. The sword travelled in a wide arc – the assailant putting their entire force behind the strike.

Uncontrolled, unbalanced.

Angling his body, the man stepped forwards and entered the space of his attacker, narrowly dodging the attack. He put one hand on the hilt of their blade and pulled diagonally downwards, continuing the momentum of the swing. His other hand reached for a dagger inside his robe. The thug was caught off guard by the sudden void in his posture and took a step forward to stabilize. He walked directly into the dagger that was poised at his throat, waiting patiently for the prey to arrive. The blade buried itself to the hilt with no resistance. 

Crossbowman on the right. 

The man dashed into the building, not sparing even a second to confirm the fate of his assailant. He grabbed the door with one hand and spun around to its left side, flinging it wide open and using it for cover. 

Thud. A crossbow bolt hit the door and splintered wood flew out. 

The man grabbed another dagger and rolled to avoid any incidental damage. Another armed thug was waiting on the left, but so surprised by the blitz maneuver, he barely had time to react. By the time the thug registered what was happening and started to swing his mace, the man had already pounced out of the roll. Springing from a low crouch, the man threw his entire weight upwards and thrust the dagger through the thug’s chin.

One more up the stairs.

Not bothering to retrieve the dagger, the man grabbed another from his robe and flung it at the crossbowman across the room. The unsuspecting victim would never get the chance to finish reloading. Blood poured out through the gaps in his fingers as clutched at his throat and sank to the floor.

The man looked up the stairs and saw the final target in the building. A burly knight, clad in plate and chain drew his sword. The knight was much better trained than the previous attackers. He held the longsword close to his body, pointing forwards and down in a fool’s guard to make best use of the height advantage and narrow space of the staircase. It would be hard to approach from below, and useless to throw a knife. They stood there at an impasse and assessed the best way to break the deadlock. 

There was a thud from the second floor and the knight turned his head to look. The man bounded up the stairs in this moment of inattention. Both of them knew this “opening” was a trap, but time was of the essence and the fight needed to be settled. The man unsheathed his main-gauche while running. The knight waited.

When they got within striking distance, the knight moved with explosive precision, stabbing at the man’s center. He flattened against the side of the staircase while parrying. Steel scraped against steel as the man tried to close distance, blades crossed. The knight stepped back and disengaged his sword, trying to maintain the advantage of a longer weapon, but the narrow stairwell didn’t allow for much maneuvering. The knight pivoted his sword to the right, but the man followed the blade and pinned it against the wall. Only an arm’s length remained between the two as the man continued to run up the stairs. 

With his free hand, the knight threw a mailed fist at the man. The man weaved and parried the blow to the side. He continued forwards, rotating his hand and snaking around their arm to grapple the knight’s elbow. He tried to pull the knight down, but their posture was too stable and the fist was retracted as soon as it shot out – just a test blow. The knight dropped his sword. It would be of no use in such close quarters. He moved to get a hold on the man with his freed up hand but was stopped short by a stab from the main-gauche heading towards his face. Using his armour to great effect, the knight deflected the dagger with his forearm and pinned the man’s arm underneath his armpit. The man smiled and pushed his arm even deeper, so close that their chests – and their centers of gravity – were connected. He wrapped his arm across the back of the knight and leaned back. They both started to fall down the stairs. The man jumped backwards and twisted while still keeping a firm hold on the knight. They flew through the air and landed heavily onto the floor, with the knight suffering the brunt of the impact. While the knight lay there dazed and winded, the man pulled out a dagger with his free hand and slashed his throat. Anger and unwillingness flitted through the knight’s eyes as his life seeped onto the floor. 

The man rolled over and panted heavily. His body was in agony and knew that it would only get worse once the thrill of battle wore off. He got up off the floor with pained, laboured movements, and went outside to retrieve the corpse of the first thug before anybody found and reported it. He dragged the body inside the house with great effort, then closed the door and slumped his body against it. After resting for a moment, he retrieved his daggers from the corpses and cleaned them off with his robe. He emptied his remaining pockets and then threw the robe into the lit fireplace. While reorganizing his belongings into the compartments of his pants and tunic, the man called out to the empty house.

“You were too casual, prince. Easy to spot. Easy to follow. What are your intentions?”

There was no response.

The man finished packing away all of his items. 

“Fine. I’ll report back to your Royal Emperor-father. Return to the palace at once, Your Highness.”

The man went to the back of the house to fetch a pail of water. He washed the makeup off his face and the dye out of his hair. Just what is that boy thinking? Openly consorting with remnants of a bygone empire…

He inspected his body for wounds. Mostly unharmed other than massive bruising along his ribs, hip, and thigh from the fall. The man tidied his appearance into the spitting image of a middle-aged merchant. He found a cane by the front door and grabbed it as he left. It should cover up for the limp that would surely form once the pain kicked in.

The man walked back into the city. The sun had long descended past the horizon and moonlight took its place to illuminate the streets.

Whose attention were you trying to grab, prince. Who are you trying to lure?
