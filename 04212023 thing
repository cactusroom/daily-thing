Chapter 1 (incomplete)
The man walked down the streets of the capital with all the leisure one would expect of an elder strolling by. His gait remained patient and measured while life bustled in every corner. Children played, merchants hawked their wares, lovers whispered sweet nothings, and the man walked.

He took in the sights and sounds around him, and gave a gentle smile to anyone who met his gaze. The man passed through the park gate and decided he would meander for a while before going on his way. As he stepped into this world of nature – so detached yet so intrinsically tied to the city – he spotted a young girl in a blue cotehardie brushing the dirt off her dress. He saw no parents paying her any mind, but it had been safe enough lately that children were free to play by themselves. He walked past.

A cool breeze swept through the park. The autumn leaves danced.

The man stopped in front of the lake to rest his aching legs for a moment. He couldn’t move like he used to; even a mild stroll through the park was taking its toll. He absentmindedly massaged his knees while watching the scenery. Ducks crowded the other shore as the baker’s wife tossed them bread crumbs. A family sat on a blanket, enjoying the last few weeks of good weather before winter settled in. Boys brandished their wooden swords and played knights and damsels. A youth in purple accosted a maiden daydreaming by the waterside. They looked around to check for spectators before starting to blush and giggle as they chatted with playful coquetry. After a while he leaned in and whispered in her ear before taking off his gold ring to place in her hands. He closed her fingers around the ring and gave a parting kiss to her cheek. She flushed red and held it to her chest while walking briskly away. 

The youth sat for a moment, basking in his accomplishment. He laid on the grass with his hands interlocked behind his head, gazing at the clouds drifting past. After his heart slowed and his face cooled, the youth stood back up and strutted across the shore to where another innocent maiden was waiting. He took a new gold ring out of his pocket and secured it onto his finger with practiced ease. The man sighed and stopped watching. He took out a quill and a roll of parchment from his robe and began to sketch the lake. 

Time passed and the sun rose to its peak. The man looked at his completed work and smiled at the day’s drawing. He picked up the quill again and wrote a message in the center of the lake.

The third prince continues his frivolous behaviour. We will prepare adequate compensation for the houses of the two maidens. Word will be sent to his teachers to reprimand further displays. He continues to lack ambition on the surface.
The common folk are living well. Children feel safe to play. Craftsmen are well fed and have extra to spare. Merchants are lively. The city flourishes under new rule. Long live Your Majesty.

The man rolled the parchment and tied it with a practiced hand. Palming it into his robe, he stood up and continued his lap around the park, giving a gentle smile to any who met his gaze. He handed the scroll to a pedestrian strolling past, then left through the gate back into the urban world. He walked down the streets and continued to observe the city and its people.
